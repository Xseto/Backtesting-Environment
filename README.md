This is a repository of code for my class and personal projects.

-AlgoTrading: implementations of algo trading strategies

-BackTestingEnv: implementations of environments to backtest strategies

-Options: code relating to options and volatility

-NeuralNetworks: implementations of neural networks in the context of finance and NLP

These are not individual projects, but rather components of projects so there
may be dependencies across folders.

Thanks!
