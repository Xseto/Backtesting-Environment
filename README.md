This is a repository of code for my class and personal projects.

-AlgoTrading: implementations of algo trading strategies
-BackTestingEnv: implementations of environments to backtest strategies
-Options: code relating to options and volatility
-NeuralNetworks: *soon to be added*

These are not individual projects, but rather components of projects so there
may be dependencies across folders.

However you have found yourself here, thanks for taking a look!
